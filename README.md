This application uses the csv menu file to load the website and generate word documents of the menu.

### Editing prices

Open up the menu.csv file and edit the prices of each item. Save the csv file.

### Generate word document menu:

Run the driver.exe executable. An Output directory should be created where the word documents were generated.

### Configuration:

To configure the files, edit the config.ini file. This file is responsible for the input/output file names, name of the new directory created, and where the template word documents are located.
